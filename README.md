This project is built to automate the attendance process using face recognition technology. It captures and identifies faces in real-time using a webcam, compares them with a stored face database, and marks attendance with a timestamp. If the face is not recognized, the system prompts the user to register, saves their face, and logs their attendance. This ensures a seamless, contactless, and efficient method for tracking presence in classrooms, offices, or secured areas.
